# AI Automation Demos

This repository contains three small internal tools demonstrating how AI-assisted
and automated workflows can support product, QA, and operations teams.

Each project is self-contained and designed to be easy to run locally.

## Projects
- AI Knowledgebase Builder
- AI QA Test Case Generator
- AI Operations Insight Generator

These tools focus on converting unstructured inputs into structured, usable outputs.
